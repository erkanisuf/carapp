**What about is this app?**
<br />
Application that uses CRUD operations . Kinda like a admin panel for car application. It fetches from api data.
<br />

**Why i did it?**
<br />
Wanted to improve CRUD operations in react and also took a look how i can fetch data from api.
<br />

**How to run ?**
<br />
git pull and npm start in terminal
<br />

**Live preview?**
<br />
Currently no live preview , it was just practise on local machine.
